In recent years, drones have moved out of the science labs and into everyday life, with several commercialized drones readily available in stores everywhere. Businesses are starting to consider the use of drones in their day-to-day business, such as Amazon recently revealing their intent to provide delivery by quadcopter within a few years. While drones currently have many use-cases, their limited battery life severely impedes their usage for long-running tasks such as extended flight.

While battery-life will surely increase as technology advances, we argue that this problem can be solved in other ways than mere brute force. In this report, we present a python framework for automated quadcopter charging named DroneCharge. With it, a series of drones are utilized to form a swarm of drones capable of cooperating to execute tasks. Using this framework, drones developers using commercially available drones are able to add automated charging and task cooperation to their repertoire with very little extra code.
