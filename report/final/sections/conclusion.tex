\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we have outlined the vision, design, and implementation of the DroneCharge framework for automated quadcopter charging. We discussed various strengths and weaknesses of the framework, and suggested ways to improve said weaknesses.

In conclusion, we argue that the DroneCharge framework fulfills its vision; it is capable of automatically returning drones to a charging station during a task, and have that task be paused and resumed by either a secondary drone or the same drone upon battery-replenishment. The framework allows developers to view their heterogenous drones as a swarm of drones with various capabilities capable of executing tasks together. Through the use of DroneCharge, drone developers are able to perform long running tasks despite the need to replenish their drones, which markably extends the potential usecases for both commercial and non-commercial drones.
